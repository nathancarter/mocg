### Practice Problems

I highly recommend the practice problems on vectors contained at [the Learning Lesson website](http://www.leadinglesson.com/vectors). Many of them are about three-dimensional vectors, and thus only apply after you have read Chapter 4, but some of them are applicable now.

### Interactive Experiences

Check out the following GeoGebraTube interactive demos to experience point and vector operations in 2D with your own mouse (or finger, on most tablet devices).

  * [Addition of two vectors](https://www.geogebratube.org/student/m26943)
  * [Addition of two vectors with components shown](https://www.geogebratube.org/student/m50342)
  * [Addition of a point and a vector](http://tube.geogebra.org/student/mC0ud98ge) (created by Kevin Liu, a student at Bentley University, for this website)
  * [Subtraction of two vectors, or two points](http://tube.geogebra.org/student/mrh7MpBiU) (created by Kevin Liu, a student at Bentley University, for this website)
  * [Multiplication of a scalar by a vector](https://www.geogebratube.org/student/m25989)
  * [Unit vectors](https://www.geogebratube.org/student/m3550)
  * [Converting a vector into its magnitude and direction, separately](http://tube.geogebra.org/student/mgM0mDgFq) (created by Kevin Liu, a student at Bentley University, for this website)
  * [Converting a separate magnitude and direction into a vector](http://tube.geogebra.org/student/ms7mbF5k1) (created by Kevin Liu, a student at Bentley University, for this website)
