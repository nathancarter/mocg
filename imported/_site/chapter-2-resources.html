<h3 id="practice-problems">Practice Problems</h3>

<p>I highly recommend the practice problems on vectors contained at <a href="http://www.leadinglesson.com/vectors">the Learning Lesson website</a>. Many of them are about three-dimensional vectors, and thus only apply after you have read Chapter 4, but some of them are applicable now.</p>

<h3 id="interactive-experiences">Interactive Experiences</h3>

<p>Check out the following GeoGebraTube interactive demos to experience point and vector operations in 2D with your own mouse (or finger, on most tablet devices).</p>
