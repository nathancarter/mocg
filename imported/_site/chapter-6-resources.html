<p>Try this <a href="http://tube.geogebra.org/student/m943413" target="_blank">interactive visualization of the dot product of two vectors in two-dimensional space</a>.</p>

<p>Try this <a href="http://tube.geogebra.org/student/m943603" target="_blank">interactive visualization of the equation of a plane in three-dimensional space</a>.</p>

<p>Try this <a href="http://tube.geogebra.org/student/m943543" target="_blank">interactive visualization of the intersection of a line of sight with a plane in three-dimensional space</a>.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the practice problems on dot products contained at <a href="http://www.leadinglesson.com/dot-product">the Learning Lesson website</a>.</p>

<p>This is useful for seeing how the concepts of this chapter (and all chapters in this part of the text) play out.  Especially if you plan to follow the programming exercises in this portion of the text, which lead you through building a simple raytracer yourself, you may want to experiment with this one to see what kind of result you can expect to achieve at the end of the exercises in question.</p>
