<p>To see ultra-slow-motion videos of objects colliding, consider the links below.  These demonstrate that, although changes in velocity may seem instantaneous when we watch them at normal speed with the naked eye, they are nonetheless continuous changes in velocity when they are slowed down.</p>

<h3 id="animated-video-explaining-the-three-levels-of-continuity">Animated video explaining the three levels of continuity</h3>

<p>Illustrates the three levels of continuity discussed in the chapter, with a car moving along various paths of motion to illustrate what each type of continuity feels like to watch in a movie.</p>

<p>If you plan to do the exercise in the text that asks you to create a video like the one above, you may be interested in having the automobile model on which it was based.  It was created by Friedrich Lohmüeller, and is available on <a href="http://www.f-lohmueller.de/pov_tut/objects/obj_950e.htm">this page</a>.</p>
