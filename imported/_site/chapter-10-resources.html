<p>This page contains links to all resources mentioned in Chapter 10 of the textbook. It begins with several ways to graph vector functions for free on the web, and concludes with how to graph them within POV-Ray scenes.  As a quick comparison, the first two methods require Java, while the third does not; but consequently the first two are interactive, while the third produces only a static image.</p>

<h3 id="calcplot3d"><a href="http://web.monroecc.edu/manila/webfiles/calcNSF/JavaCode/CalcPlot3D.htm">CalcPlot3D</a></h3>

<p>A useful tool for graphing vector functions and other kinds of 3D objects.  Although this applet was created for use in calculus classes, it is useful to us as well.  Use the following procedure to graph a vector function in CalcPlot3D.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Erase the default shape that appears, by unchecking the box next to Function 1 and clicking the Graph button immediately above it.</li>
  <li>Add a parametric curve by clicking the Graph menu and choosing Add a Space Curve.</li>
  <li>In the three blanks provided, enter the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> components of the vector function, using <em>t</em> as the parameter. The default bounds for <em>t</em> (from -10 to 10) may be sensible for your function, but you can change them.</li>
  <li>Click Graph (on the popup window into which you typed the parametric equations).</li>
  <li>Click and drag to view from different angles.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sage"><a href="http://www.sagemath.org">Sage</a></h3>

<p>A powerful mathematics tool that you can use on your own computer or on the web.  <a href="http://aleph.sagemath.org">Here is a link to a webpage that evaluates Sage code</a> and shows you the result immediately.  Type in code like the following to graph a vector function.  (Replace the three components of the vector function with any three vector function components.)  The 0 and 2π are the bounds on <em>t</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>var('t')
parametric_plot3d([cos(t),sin(t),t],(0,2*pi))</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="wolframalpha"><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">Wolfram|Alpha</a></h3>

<p>Like Sage, this online math tool does far more than just graphing vector functions, but we can use it for that, too.  In the input box, type input like the following.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>parametric plot (t*cos t, t*sin t,t), t=0..6pi</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>To see that example plotted, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=parametric+plot+%28t*cos+t%2C+t*sin+t%2Ct%29%2C+t%3D0..6pi">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Download this file by clicking <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/t10l4e64sibkqw8/vector-functions.inc?dl=0">vector-functions.inc</a>.  Instructions for using it appear in the textbook, and you can download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ojvaunnnd8gee1b/vector-demo.pov?dl=0">vector-demo.pov</a> to see how I have used it in a demo.</p>
