### High-speed videos of collisions

To see ultra-slow-motion videos of objects colliding, consider the links below.  These demonstrate that, although changes in velocity may seem instantaneous when we watch them at normal speed with the naked eye, they are nonetheless continuous changes in velocity when they are slowed down.

  * [A baseball hitting a bat at 140 mph](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLcVTjiYmoM) (YouTube video from Washington State University's Sports Science Lab)
  * [What happens when ball meets bat?](http://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/bats/ball-bat-0.html) (web page with videos, by Daniel Russell, professor at Pennsylvania State University)

### Animated video explaining the three levels of continuity

Illustrates the three levels of continuity discussed in the chapter, with a car moving along various paths of motion to illustrate what each type of continuity feels like to watch in a movie.

### The car object in that video

If you plan to do the exercise in the text that asks you to create a video like the one above, you may be interested in having the automobile model on which it was based.  It was created by Friedrich Lohmüeller, and is available on [this page](http://www.f-lohmueller.de/pov_tut/objects/obj_950e.htm).
