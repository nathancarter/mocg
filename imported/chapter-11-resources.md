# Bézier curve simplifier

# Interactive cubic Bézier curves

Try [this interactive website](http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/svg-curves/cubic-curve.html) for cubic Bézier curves in two dimensions. It allows you to move anywhere in on the page the four control points, and it shows the corresponding function _P_(_t_) built using the formula given in this chapter of the textbook. You can see how the control points determine the curve as you drag them around.

# Car-and-track scene

You can [download the .pov scene file containing the car and track](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r75ou4lbl6re6za/car-turns.pov?dl=0), for use in exercises that ask you to modify it.

# Explosion Example

This shows what it could look like to apply to the sphere in the POV basic scene the explosion macro you are asked to build in one of this chapter's advanced programming exercises. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaIAS1lG88I]
