This page contains links to all resources mentioned in Chapter 12 of the textbook.  In addition to the resources listed below, [some resources from Chapter 11 remain relevant](http://mocg.wordpress.com/chapter-11-resources/ "Chapter 11 Resources").

## Interactive quadratic Bézier curve page

On [the Chapter 11 page](http://mocg.wordpress.com/chapter-11-resources/ "Chapter 11 Resources"), I included a link to a page where you could [play with cubic Bézier curves](http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/svg-curves/cubic-curve.html).  Now that Chapter 12 has introduced the whole family of Bézier curves of different degrees, you may also be interested in [the corresponding quadratic page](http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/svg-curves/quadratic-curve.html).

## The de Casteljau Algorithm Applet

The de Casteljau algorithm is the iterative construction of higher-degree Bézier curves from compositions of linear interpolations.  [An interactive animation of that algorithm is available here.](http://geogebratube.com/student/m8579)
