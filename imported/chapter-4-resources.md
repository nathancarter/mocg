### Practice Problems

I highly recommend the practice problems on vectors contained at [the Learning Lesson website](http://www.leadinglesson.com/vectors). I mentioned these same problems in Chapter 2, but only some were applicable then, because you had not yet learned about three dimensional space. Now, all such problems are good practice.

### POV File of Three Keys Scene

Download the file [three-keys.pov](https://www.dropbox.com/s/slfwjwfkbjixstx/three-keys.pov?dl=0) here.  This will render the scene shown in the text, and the source can be inspected to see how it was created.

### [Animations of 3D Affine Transformations](http://mocg.wordpress.com/animations-of-affine-transformations-in-3d/ "Animations of Affine Transformations in 3D")

  * Translation of a wedge-shaped object by ⟨3,2,-3⟩, _T_<sub>3,2,-3</sub>
  * Scaling the same object by factors of 1/2, 1/2, and 3, in _x_, _y_, and _z_, respectively, _S_<sub>1/2,1/2,3</sub>
  * Reflecting the same object through the _yz_ plane, _F_
  * Rotation of the same object by -65° around the _x_ axis, _R_<sub>-65°,0,0</sub>
  * Rotation of the same object by 45° around the _y_ axis, _R_<sub>0,45°,0</sub>
  * Rotation of the same object by 60° around the _z_ axis, _R_<sub>0,0,60°</sub>
  * Combination of several transformations applied to the same object in sequence, _T_<sub>-2,0,0</sub>_R_<sub>0,0,60°</sub>_S_<sub>1/3,1/3,1/3</sub>

### [Frank Hanish's 3D Transformations Applet](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~cs234325/Applets/applets/transformation/GermanApplet.html)

A Java applet for experimenting with 3D affine transformations

Warning: Feel free to ignore the grid of numbers on the bottom of that page until you reach Chapter 5 in the textbook.

_**I still should add here a tutorial on this applet. It is nontrivial, because it requires understanding a stack of matrices onto which you push values.**_

### [Page of 3D Axes (PDF)](http://45.79.175.103/natewp/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/page-of-3d-axes.pdf)

For doing the homework for this chapter, you will need to draw some objects in three-dimensional coordinate systems. Rather than make you draw them yourself, this page will save you time and help keep your work neat.
