## Spreadsheet Exercise

Download here a copy of the spreadsheet mentioned in the exercises for this chapter.  The download contains only the structure, with no formulas; the exercise asks you to fill in the formulas.  Get it in [the old Excel format (.xls)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ft453fafjmajcy3/Lighting%20Assignment.xls?dl=0) or [the new Excel format (.xlsx)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ex3v2mkj2iaj4wp/Lighting%20Assignment.xlsx?dl=0).  Other spreadsheet software (such as [OpenOffice.org's Calc](http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html) or [Apple's Numbers.app](http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/)) should open at least one of those two formats.

Also, [some resources from Chapter 6 remain relevant](http://mocg.wordpress.com/chapter-6-resources/ "Chapter 6 Resources"), especially the link to the JavaScript raytracer for the programming exercises.
