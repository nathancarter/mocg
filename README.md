To build the site:

 * Ensure [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and its [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) are installed:
    * `pip install mkdocs-material`
    * Don't use `apt install` or `brew install` for `mkdocs` or `mkdocs` won't find the material theme.
    * If you already had `mkdocs` installed by one of those means, uninstall every copy and start again.
    * [See details here.](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/troubleshooting/)
 * Preview the site with `mkdocs serve`.
 * If it looks good, rebuild with `mkdocs build`.
 * Commit and push to make it live.
