## Spreadsheet Exercise

Download here a copy of the spreadsheet mentioned in the exercises for this
chapter.  The download contains only the structure, with no formulas; the
exercise asks you to fill in the formulas.

Choose a format:

 * [The old Excel format (.xls)](files/Lighting%20Assignment.xls)
 * [The new Excel format (.xlsx)](files/Lighting%20Assignment.xlsx).

Other spreadsheet software (such as [OpenOffice.org's
Calc](http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html) or [Apple's
Numbers.app](http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/)) should open at least one
of those two formats.

Also, [some resources from Chapter 6 remain
relevant](chapter-6-resources.md), especially the link to the JavaScript
raytracer for the programming exercises.
