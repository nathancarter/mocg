This page contains links to all resources mentioned in Chapter 12 of the
textbook.  In addition to the resources listed below, [some resources from
Chapter 11 remain relevant](chapter-11-resources.md).

## Interactive quadratic Bézier curve page

On [the Chapter 11 page](chapter-11-resources.md), I included a link to a
page where you could [play with cubic Bézier
curves](http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/svg-curves/cubic-curve.html).
Now that Chapter 12 has introduced the whole family of Bézier curves of
different degrees, you may also be interested in [the corresponding
quadratic
page](http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/svg-curves/quadratic-curve.html).

## The de Casteljau Algorithm Applet

The de Casteljau algorithm is the iterative construction of higher-degree
Bézier curves from compositions of linear interpolations.  [An interactive
animation of that algorithm is available
here.](http://geogebratube.com/student/m8579)
