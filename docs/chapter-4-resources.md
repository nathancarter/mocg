### Practice Problems

I highly recommend the practice problems on vectors contained at [the
Learning Lesson website](http://www.leadinglesson.com/vectors). I mentioned
these same problems in Chapter 2, but only some were applicable then,
because you had not yet learned about three dimensional space. Now, all such
problems are good practice.

### POV File of Three Keys Scene

Download the file [three-keys.pov](files/three-keys.pov) here.  This will
render the scene shown in the text, and the source can be inspected to see
how it was created.

  * Translation of a wedge-shaped object by
    $\langle 3,2,-3\rangle$, $T_{3,2,-3}$
  * Scaling the same object by factors of 1/2, 1/2, and 3, in $x$, $y$,
    and $z$, respectively, $S_{1/2,1/2,3}$
  * Reflecting the same object through the $yz$ plane, $F$
  * Rotation of the same object by $-65^\circ$ around
    the $x$ axis, $R_{-65^\circ,0,0}$
  * Rotation of the same object by $45^\circ$ around
    the $y$ axis, $R_{0,45^\circ,0}$
  * Rotation of the same object by $60^\circ$ around
    the $z$ axis, $R_{0,0,60^\circ}$
  * Combination of several transformations applied to the same object in
    sequence, $T_{-2,0,0}R_{0,0,60^\circ}S_{1/3,1/3,1/3}$

### [Frank Hanish's 3D Transformations Applet](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~cs234325/Applets/applets/transformation/GermanApplet.html)

A Java applet for experimenting with 3D affine transformations

!!! Warning
    Feel free to ignore the grid of numbers on the bottom of that page
    until you reach Chapter 5 in the textbook.

I still should add here a tutorial on this applet. It is nontrivial, because
it requires understanding a stack of matrices onto which you push values.

### [Page of 3D Axes (PDF)](http://45.79.175.103/natewp/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/page-of-3d-axes.pdf)

For doing the homework for this chapter, you will need to draw some objects
in three-dimensional coordinate systems. Rather than make you draw them
yourself, this page will save you time and help keep your work neat.
