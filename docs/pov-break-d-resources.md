## Project Information for Instructors

When my students do this project, I create a wiki page in our course
management system (Blackboard) that contains instructions for how they can
post their work to that wiki.  I create one central page that is empty, and
students claim a category and a set of objects within it by editing the
central page and creating a section for their category, and putting a few
objects within that section, attached to their name.  It might look like the
example shown below.  They make their name and object list a link to a new
wiki page, and place all their writing there.

> **Furniture**
>
> [Coffee table, sofa, and bookcase &#8211; John Doe](pov-break-d-resources.md)
>
> [Lamp, dining room table, and ottoman &#8211; Jane Doe](pov-break-d-resources.md)
>
> **Toys**
>
> [A variety of Lego bricks &#8211; Juan Doe](pov-break-d-resources.md)
>
> (etc.)

Everyone is required to make different objects. Although more than one
person can work within a category, they cannot make the same objects.

Having the whole class share their material in a central location like this
makes it possible, in later projects, for students to use not only the few
objects they created in this project, but the many objects created by the
entire class.  In my experience, many final projects take advantage of this
repository of objects.  It's nice for a student to see their work picked up
by someone else and used in a new context; they can see that their work was
appreciated and useful.

Here are example categories I provide to give people ideas and guide them
into categories that are rather reusable.

 * **Furniture (chair, desk, lamp, bookshelf, etc.)**

    Reusable because: Lots of indoor scenes can be made to look more
    realistic by adding some furniture.

 * **Houses (ranch, cape, mansion, high-rise apartment complex, castle,
   etc.)**

    Reusable because:Lots of outdoor scenes can be made to look more
    realistic by putting several common outdoor objects like houses together
    in the background (or the foreground).

 * **Signs (road signs, billboards, green interstate direction signs, rest
   room signs, etc.)**

    Reusable because:These can be used to decorate any scene in which they
    could realistically appear, and therefore add realism and detail.

 * **Tableware (plates, cups, spoons, bowls, glasses, napkins, etc.)**

    Reusable because:Any still life scene could reasonably include objects
    like these.

 * **Food (fruit, bread, cookies, etc.)**

    Reusable because:Same reason as previous

 * **Office supplies (book, stapler, phone, pen, picture frame, coffee cup,
   etc.)**

    Reusable because:Same reason as previous

 * **Any particular brand of toys (e.g., one category is Lego<sup>TM</sup>
   blocks, another is Tinker Toys<sup>TM</sup>, another is Lincoln
   Logs<sup>TM</sup>, etc.)**

    Reusable because: One could make an entire POV scene out of just one
    type of toy.  The example I do for this project (which is already on the
    wiki) is done using Tinker Toys.

 * **Any other category you come up with,** as longs as its objects are
   likely to be usable in future scenes. E.g., bad ideas include "electric
   guitars" and "bunny slippers." Build something that you and/or your
   classmates may find useful in future projects.

I use the following grading criteria.
