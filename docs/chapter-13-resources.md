## High-speed videos of collisions

To see ultra-slow-motion videos of objects colliding, consider the links
below.  These demonstrate that, although changes in velocity may seem
instantaneous when we watch them at normal speed with the naked eye, they
are nonetheless continuous changes in velocity when they are slowed down.

## Animated video explaining the three levels of continuity

Illustrates the three levels of continuity discussed in the chapter, with a
car moving along various paths of motion to illustrate what each type of
continuity feels like to watch in a movie.

## The car object in that video

If you plan to do the exercise in the text that asks you to create a video
like the one above, you may be interested in having the automobile model on
which it was based.  It was created by Friedrich Lohmüeller, and is
available on [this
page](http://www.f-lohmueller.de/pov_tut/objects/obj_950e.htm).
