### Interactive Visualizations

All created by Bentley University honors student Kevin Cox:

 * [The dot product of two vectors in two-dimensional
   space](http://tube.geogebra.org/student/m943413)
 * [The equation of a plane in three-dimensional
   space](http://tube.geogebra.org/student/m943603)
 * [The intersection of a line of sight with a plane in three-dimensional
   space](http://tube.geogebra.org/student/m943543)

### Practice Problems

I highly recommend the practice problems on dot products contained at [the
Learning Lesson website](http://www.leadinglesson.com/dot-product).

### [A simple ray-tracer built in JavaScript](https://nathancarter.github.io/html-ray)

This is useful for seeing how the concepts of this chapter (and all chapters
in this part of the text) play out.  Especially if you plan to follow the
programming exercises in this portion of the text, which lead you through
building a simple raytracer yourself, you may want to experiment with this
one to see what kind of result you can expect to achieve at the end of the
exercises in question.
