### Practice Problems

I highly recommend the practice problems on vectors contained at [the
Learning Lesson website](http://www.leadinglesson.com/vectors). Many of them
are about three-dimensional vectors, and thus only apply after you have read
Chapter 4, but some of them are applicable now.

### Interactive Experiences

Check out the following GeoGebraTube interactive demos to experience point
and vector operations in 2D with your own mouse (or finger, on most tablet
devices).
