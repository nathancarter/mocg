## Practice Problems

!!! tip
    I highly recommend the practice problems on vectors contained at [the
    Learning Lesson website](http://www.leadinglesson.com/vectors). Many of
    them are about three-dimensional vectors, and thus only apply after you
    have read Chapter 4, but some of them are applicable now.

## Interactive Experiences

Check out the following GeoGebraTube interactive demos to experience point
and vector operations in 2D with your own mouse (or finger, on most tablet
devices).
