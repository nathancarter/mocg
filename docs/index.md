# Welcome

This website is for the textbook _Introduction to the Mathematics of
Computer Graphics_, published by the Mathematical Association
of America.

It has links and resources for readers, both students and
instructors.  I aim for it to evolve and improve for the foreseeable future.
See content links to the left.
