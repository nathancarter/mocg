# Welcome

This website is for the textbook _Introduction to the Mathematics of
Computer Graphics_, published by the Mathematical Association
of America.

It has links and resources for readers, both students and
instructors.  I aim for it to evolve and improve for the foreseeable future.
See content links to the left.

# News

The textbook has won the 2021 Beckenback Book Prize!  Thanks to the MAA and
all who contributed to the text.

# Online exercises

Dozens of exercises related to the text exist in the WeBWorK Open Problem
Library.  You can read about the library [here](https://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Open_Problem_Library),
but to be able to browse it, you'll need a WeBWorK installation, as documented
on that page.  The source code for the mathematics of computer graphics
exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/openwebwork/webwork-open-problem-library/tree/master/OpenProblemLibrary/BentleyUniversity/MathematicsOfComputerGraphics).
